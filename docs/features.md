# Features of Mini-SGLang

## Online Serving

Mini-SGLang supports online serving with an OpenAI-compatible API server. It provides the standard `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, allowing seamless integration with existing tools and clients. For detailed command-line arguments and configuration options, run `python -m minisgl --help`.

## Interactive Shell Mode

For demonstration and testing purposes, an interactive shell mode is available. In this mode, users can input prompts directly, and the LLM will generate responses in real-time. The shell automatically caches chat history to maintain context. To clear the conversation history and start a new session, use the `/reset` command.

Example:

```bash
python -m minisgl --model "/models/DeepSeek-V4-Flash" --tp-size 8 --shell
```

## Distributed Serving

To scale performance across multiple GPUs, Mini-SGLang supports Tensor Parallelism (TP). You can enable distributed serving by specifying the number of GPUs with the `--tp n` argument, where `n` is the degree of parallelism.

## Supported Models

This release supports DeepSeek V4 Flash (`DeepseekV4ForCausalLM`) only, with
the NVIDIA A100/sm80 TP8 configuration as its validated deployment target.

## Chunked Prefill

Chunked Prefill, a technique introduced by [Sarathi-Serve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02310), is enabled by default. This feature splits long prompts into smaller chunks during the prefill phase, significantly reducing peak memory usage and preventing Out-Of-Memory (OOM) errors in long-context serving. The chunk size can be configured using `--max-prefill-length n`. Note that setting `n` to a very small value (e.g., 128) is not recommended as it may significantly degrade performance.

## Page Size

You can specify the page size of the system using the `--page-size` argument.

## Attention Backends

Mini-SGLang exposes only the DeepSeek V4 attention backend (`dsv4`). The
optimized and fallback runtime modes share this backend; FlashInfer remains a
runtime dependency for sampling, not as a selectable attention backend.

## CUDA Graph

To minimize CPU launch overhead during decoding, Mini-SGLang supports capturing and replaying CUDA graphs. This feature is enabled by default. The maximum batch size for CUDA graph capture can be set with `--cuda-graph-max-bs n`. Setting `n` to `0` disables this feature.

## Radix Cache

Adopting the original design from [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang.git), Mini-SGLang implements a Radix Cache to manage the Key-Value (KV) cache. This allows the reuse of KV cache for shared prefixes across requests, reducing redundant computation. This feature is enabled by default but can be switched to a naive cache management strategy using `--cache naive`.

## Overlap Scheduling

To further reduce CPU overhead, Mini-SGLang employs overlap scheduling, a technique proposed in [NanoFlow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12757). This approach overlaps the CPU scheduling overhead with GPU computation, improving overall system throughput.
